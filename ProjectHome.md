web2help is a help authoring tool, for quick generation of simple CHM files.

As the name suggests, web2help grabs help pages from the Web. This means that you can create the pages with your favorite tool (a CMS or a Wiki, for instance). Then you tell web2help where to look... and your CHM file is ready!

N.B.: in order to compile the help file, web2help uses HTML Help Workshop. You need to download it for free from Microsoft.
